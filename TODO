Todo List
=========

  - Add checking for calls to `MarkovBuilder.generate()` before any calls to `train()`
  - Optimize cache (since n-th order is also (n - 1)th, (n-2)th, etc. order implicitly)
  - Split `Markov.StateDict` into compiled and noncompiled versions
  - Add pickle compression
  - Use a better seralization for the data
  - Optimize SQLite retrieval (generator still loads everything into memory)
